    "## Theory\n",
    "When it comes to data acquisition, there are certain terms we must be familiar with to understand how the acquisition works and correctly set it up. Here are a few terms that might be unknown to beginners in this field:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Triggering moment** - The point in time where the trigger condition is met and the instrument starts capturing data. \n",
    "- **Trigger condition** - Composed of trigger level and signal front.\n",
    "- **Trigger level** - the value of the input signal in Volts at which the acquisition will start\n",
    "- **Signal front** - also reffered to as **positive/negative edge** (mostly used for digital logic). The point in time where a signal becomes *high* is called a positive edge, while the moment it becomes *low* is a negative edge. With analog signals, this refers to how the signal crosses the trigger level. A positive edge means the signal must be lower and rise to the trigger level, and for a negative edge, the signal must be higher and fall to the trigger level to meet the trigger condition.  \n",
    "- **Decimation** - Refers to how many samples are skipped before a sample is saved. For example, if we set decimation to 10, Red Pitaya saves every tenth sample, while the other nine are discarded. Indirectly defines the sampling frequency.\n",
    "- **Averaging** - When decimation is higher than one, each saved sample is an average of all skipped samples. By default, this is turned *on*.\n",
    "- **Acquisition units** - The units can either be set to *RAW*, where the value is taken directly from the Red Pitaya's ADC, or *Volts*, where Red Pitaya automatically performs the conversion. By default, this is set to *Volts*.\n",
    "- **Trigger delay** - Defines how many samples the triggering moment is delayed. If the trigger delay is set to 0, the triggering moment is in the middle of the returned data buffer. A positive trigger delay moves the triggering moment towards the start of the buffer, and a negative trigger delay moves it towards the end of the buffer. By default, this is set to 0.\n",

The so-called \"loopback\" does not have many applications in practice, but is perfect for this demonstration. In practice, an external signal is applied directly to the Red Pitaya's inputs."
